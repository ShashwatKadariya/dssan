                    The Anteaters in Education alumni network includes over 12,000+ graduates from UCI education programs
                    and degrees, as well as UCI graduates from any major who now work in (or are retired from) education or
                    an education-related field. We also extend a warm welcome to local educators who participate in
                    continuing education courses through the UCI Teacher Academy.

                    professionals. I hope that you stay connected and continue to thrive in your respective fields, as we
                    need educational leaders like you to shape the world for a better future for all learners.
